# Greeno
Greeno is a great optimal solution from two different sides:
1. it gives you the oppurtinity to contribute with your suggestion and idea about recycling so all people can use your knowledge in a good way 
2. you have the chance also to sell your extra items instead of throughing them out 
3. all the information in this app will be provided from people to people so don't worry all of them are practical. no theories here.
4. Greeno is extention for ReduceRuseRecycle project, so we added new feature to this project which are :-
  1. User has two options when wanna sign up 
    a- The first one is to regist as a normal user, so he can only see the stuff and take it as free or buy it.
    b- The seconed one is sign up as supplier, so he can add some stuff to sell it.
  2. we have two pages Paid-products and Free-products
  3. user can add his location and his product image
